# ThreeLayerBP
This is some kind of a toy thing, used to approach a given linear or nonlinear function using a three layer neural network. Clone this repo and edit in the jupyter notebook.
    
    git clone https://github.com/JohnfyBUPT/ThreeLayerBP.git
    cd ThreeLayerBP
    jupyter notebook

You may need to pip install numpy and matplotlib first, and keras if you like.

## self implemented version
Open ApproachAndView.ipynb and run the two cells to see the loss. You can change the implementations in neural_nets/NonLinearNet.py.

## keras version
Open KerasImplementation.ipynb and run the cells, it's pretty simple.
