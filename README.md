# ThreeLayerBP
This thing is used to approach a given linear or nonlinear function using a three layer neural network. Clone this repo and edit in the jupyter notebook.

## self implemented version
Open ApproachAndView.ipynb and run the two cells to see the loss. You can change the implementations in neural_nets/NonLinearNet.py.

## keras version
Open KerasImplementation.ipynb and run the cells, it's pretty simple.
